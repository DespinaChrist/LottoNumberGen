# LottoNumberGen
In this project I built a front end app that generates 6, plus 1 bonus, numbers for the game called "Lotto".

You can play the game with friends by writing down on a piece of paper 6+1 numbers and then pressing the "Click to Play!". The player that guessed 
the most numbers wins the prize that it was determined.
